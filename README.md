# What the challenge is about?

Qazi: 
What I would suggest you do is create a web scraper for weather forecast (from forecast.weather.gov), and then write the days of the week & the temperatures (in your local city) to a CSV file that you can then open up in Excel. 
Essentially, all it does is it takes the temperature - period & short description - and it puts them into an Excel file. So if you can do a challenge like that, then that would be phenomenal. 

If you want to come up with your own challenge, feel free to do so as well...

If you actually develop these skills, then these are the skills that are going to make you a profitable developer who can charge what they're worth.
